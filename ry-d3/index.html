                        Australia, often proud as one of the safest countries in the
                        Western world, has an incongruously high incidence of
                        burglaries and break-ins. Surprisingly, based on private and
                        governmental security statistics, Australia ranks seventh
                        globally for the number of burglaries, and this rank has
                        kept increasing. Victoria, the country's most populous
                        state, is not exempt from this challenge. Recent data from
                        the Victoria Crime Statistics Bureau indicates a concerning
                        uptick in burglary-related incidents over the past year,
                        with a notable surge of over 80% in burglaries involving
                        juveniles (See more details). This report delves into this
                        problematic trend, aiming to dissect its underlying causes
                        and help residents assess the safety of their homes.

                        A common misconception is equating a local government
                        area's (LGA) overall crime rate with its burglary rate.
                        An LGA with a low crime rate might still experience a
                        high incidence of burglaries. Regional economic
                        conditions, community surveillance levels, and available
                        police resources play significant roles. Simply relying
                        on crime rate maps often doesn't provide insightful data
                        on burglary-specific trends, necessitating a deeper
                        focus on the unique characteristics and changes of
                        burglaries.

                        In Victoria, burglary rates vary significantly across
                        LGAs, highlighting the crucial role of community
                        vigilance in curbing such incidents. Intruders typically
                        shy away from areas with dense populations due to the
                        heightened risk of detection. For those residing in LGAs
                        with elevated burglary frequencies, particularly in
                        locales characterized by abundant foliage and sparse
                        neighbours, extra precautions are necessary. Beyond
                        property damage, burglaries can escalate into violent
                        crimes, jeopardizing personal safety. The adjacent
                        visualization offers a decade-long perspective on the
                        shifting burglary trend in each LGA.

                        often determine their choice. While high-value items
                        like jewellery, cash, and laptops are obvious
                        attractions, practical household items also appeal to
                        them. The adjacent graphic depicts the monetary loss
                        from various stolen items during burglaries over the
                        past decade. A notable trend emerges: today's intruders
                        increasingly target everyday essentials. Excluding

                        What is certain is that crime rates in Victoria,
                        especially the number of burglaries, have rebounded
                        significantly. Even if there are no valuables like
                        jewellery in the house, it can attract intruders. As
                        residents of Victoria, it is important for us to be
                        prepared and safe for the possibility of more burglaries
                        in the future, especially those in high-crime LGAs. Here
                        are some actionable suggestions:

                                Install protective doors, windows and locks, and
                                ensure all entrances have appropriate security
                                equipment. Some people also choose to use iron
                                bars or guardrails to enhance the security of
                                their windows.

                            <dd>
                                Ensure vegetation around your home is kept from
                                providing a hiding place for burglars. Prune
                                trees and shrubs regularly.

                            <dt><b>Network with neighbours</b></dt>
                            <dd>Starting a neighbourhood watch or maintaining good relationships with neighbours can help each other monitor homes and report suspicious activity.

                            <dt><b>Store and record valuables</b></dt>
                            <dd>Label your valuables and save their purchase receipts, photos or serial numbers. This action will make it easier to retrieve the item if it has been
                                stolen.</dd>
                        </dl>
                        Following the advice above can significantly reduce the
                        risk of burglarising your home.
